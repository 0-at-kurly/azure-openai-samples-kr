      "\n",
      "### Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Outer Query:**\n",
      "   - The outer query selects the `name` of departments from the `Department` table (`d`).\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```sql\n",
      "   SELECT d.name\n",
      "   FROM Department d\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **WHERE Clause in the Outer Query:**\n",
      "   - The outer query has a `WHERE` clause that checks if the `id` of the department is in a subquery.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   ```sql\n",
      "   WHERE d.id IN (\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **First Subquery:**\n",
      "   - This subquery selects `department_id` from the `Employee` table (`e`). Hence, the outer query is interested in departments that satisfy the conditions inside this subquery.\n",
      "   \n",
      "   ```sql\n",
      "   SELECT e.department_id\n",
      "   FROM Employee e\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Second Subquery:**\n",
      "   - Inside the first subquery, there is another subquery that is part of a `WHERE` clause. This subquery selects `employee_id` from the `Salary_Payments` table (`sp`) where the `date` is within the last 3 months from the current date.\n",
