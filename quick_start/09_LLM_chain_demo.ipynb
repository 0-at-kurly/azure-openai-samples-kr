Prompt engineering skills help to better understand the capabilities and limitations of large language models (LLMs). Researchers use prompt engineering to improve the capacity of LLMs on a wide range of common and complex tasks such as question answering and arithmetic reasoning. Developers use prompt engineering to design robust and effective prompting techniques that interface with LLMs and other tools.</p>\\n<p>This guide covers the basics of standard prompts to provide a rough idea of how to use prompts to interact and instruct large language models (LLMs). </p>\\n<p>All examples are tested with <code>text-davinci-003</code> (using OpenAI\\'s playground) unless otherwise specified. It uses the default configurations, e.g., <code>temperature=0.7</code> and <code>top-p=1</code>.</p>\\n<p>Topic:\\n- <a href=\"#basic-prompts\">Basic Prompts</a>\\n- <a href=\"#a-word-on-llm-settings\">A Word on LLM Settings</a>\\n- <a href=\"#standard-prompts\">Standard Prompts</a>\\n- <a href=\"#elements-of-a-prompt\">Prompt Elements</a>\\n- <a href=\"#general-tips-for-designing-prompts\">General Tips for Designing Prompts</a></p>\\n<hr />\\n<h2 id=\"basic-prompts\">Basic Prompts</h2>\\n<p>You can already achieve a lot with prompts, but the quality of results depends on how much information you provide it. A prompt can contain information like the <code>instruction</code> or <code>question</code> you are passing to the model and include other details such as <code>inputs</code> or <code>examples</code>. </p>\\n<p>Here is a basic example of a simple prompt:</p>\\n<p><em>Prompt</em></p>\\n<pre><code>The sky is\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>Output:</em></p>\\n<pre><code>blue\\nThe sky is blue on a clear day. On a cloudy day, the sky may be gray or white.\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>As you can see, the language model outputs a continuation of strings that make sense given the context <code>\"The sky is\"</code>. The output might be unexpected or far from the task we want to accomplish. </p>\\n<p>This basic example also highlights the necessity to provide more context or instructions on what specifically we want to achieve.</p>\\n<p>Let\\'s try to improve it a bit:</p>\\n<p><em>Prompt:</em></p>\\n<pre><code>Complete the sentence: \\nThe sky is\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>Output:</em></p>\\n<pre><code> so beautiful today.\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Is that better? Well, we told the model to complete the sentence so the result looks a lot better as it follows exactly what we told it to do (\"complete the sentence\"). This approach of designing optimal prompts to instruct the model to perform a task is what\\'s referred to as <strong>prompt engineering</strong>. </p>\\n<p>The example above is a basic illustration of what\\'s possible with LLMs today. Today\\'s LLMs can perform all kinds of advanced tasks that range from text summarization to mathematical reasoning to code generation.</p>\\n<hr />\\n<h2 id=\"a-word-on-llm-settings\">A Word on LLM Settings</h2>\\n<p>When working with prompts, you will be interacting with the LLM via an API or directly. You can configure a few parameters to get different results for your prompts. </p>\\n<p><strong>Temperature</strong> - In short, the lower the temperature the more deterministic the results in the sense that the highest probable next token is always picked. Increasing the temperature could lead to more randomness encouraging more diverse or creative outputs. We are essentially increasing the weights of the other possible tokens. In terms of application, we might want to use a lower temperature for something like fact-based QA to encourage more factual and concise responses. For poem generation or other creative tasks, it might be beneficial to increase the temperature. </p>\\n<p><strong>Top_p</strong> - Similarly, with top_p, a sampling technique with temperature called nucleus sampling, you can control how deterministic the model is at generating a response. If you are looking for exact and factual answers keep this low. If you are looking for more diverse responses, increase to a higher value. </p>\\n<p>The general recommendation is to alter one, not both.</p>\\n<p>Before starting with some basic examples, keep in mind that your results may vary depending on the version of LLM you are using. </p>\\n<hr /> <h1 id=\"advanced-prompting\">Advanced Prompting</h1>\\n<p>By this point, it should be obvious that it helps to improve prompts to get better results on different tasks. That\\'s the whole idea behind prompt engineering. </p>\\n<p>While those examples were fun, let\\'s cover a few concepts more formally before we jump into more advanced concepts. </p>\\n<p>Topics:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><a href=\"#zero-shot-prompting\">Zero-shot Prompting</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"#few-shot-prompting\">Few-shot Prompting</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"#chain-of-thought-prompting\">Chain-of-Thought Prompting</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"#zero-shot-cot\">Zero-shot CoT</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"#self-consistency\">Self-Consistency</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"#generated-knowledge-prompting\">Generate Knowledge Prompting</a></li>\\n<li><a href=\"#automatic-prompt-engineer-ape\">Automatic Prompt Engineer</a></li>\\n</ul>\\n<hr />\\n<h2 id=\"zero-shot-prompting\">Zero-Shot Prompting</h2>\\n<p>LLMs today trained on large amounts of data and tuned to follow instructions, are capable of performing tasks zero-shot. We tried a few zero-shot examples in the previous section. Here is one of the examples we used:</p>\\n<p><em>Prompt:</em></p>\\n<pre><code>Classify the text into neutral, negative, or positive. \\nText: I think the vacation is okay.\\nSentiment:\\n</code></pre>\\n<p><em>Output:</em></p>\\n<pre><code>Neutral\\n</code></pre>\\n<p>Note that in the prompt above we didn\\'t provide the model with any examples -- that\\'s the zero-shot capabilities at work. When zero-shot doesn\\'t work, it\\'s recommended to provide demonstrations or examples in the prompt. Below we discuss the approach known as few-shot prompting.</p>\\n<hr />'"
